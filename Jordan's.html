<h3>Why you should choose Jordan's</h3>
<p>
  Michael Jordan’s signature shoe, often referred to as Jordan’s or J’s, is a drastically different in comparison to KD’s or Lebrons. J’s are widely known for their fashionable appearance. Many players do not wear Jordan’s anymore to play basketball because they are not particularly comfortable to run in, they have a weak amount traction, and they get scuffed extremely easily. Jordan’s, however, are the most stylish shoe on the market. They can be worn with almost any outfit (without looking foolish), which is not necessarily the case with KD’s or Lebron’s.
