<h3>Why you should choose Lebron's</h3>

<p>
  Lebronâ€™s shoe features a combination of a stylish and comfortable feel, and allow for great success on and outside of the basketball court. On the basketball court, the Lebron 16 (his newest shoe) introduces a new form of technology that allows for a balance of comfort and traction. Generally, traction is needed in order for the player to run on the court without falling. The combination of the surrounding battle-knit material and the Nike Air Max Sole is guaranteed to suffice your needs. The battle-knit material is strong and durable, allowing for the shoe to last a lifetime.
